# ChatGPT API Login Guide

## Important: Browser Window Management

When you start the ChatGPT API server, a browser window will automatically open to handle the login process. **It's crucial that you keep this browser window open during the entire login process.**

## Step-by-Step Login Process

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
python3 start_server.py
```

### 2. Browser Opens Automatically
- A browser window will open and navigate to ChatGPT
- You'll see clear instructions in the terminal

### 3. Complete Login in Browser
- **DO NOT close the browser window**
- Log in to ChatGPT using your credentials
- Wait for the automation to detect successful login

### 4. Server Becomes Ready
- Once login is detected, the server will start accepting API requests
- You'll see "ChatGPT automation ready! Server can now accept requests."

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ❌ Browser Window Closed During Login
**Problem**: You accidentally closed the browser window while logging in
**Solution**: Restart the server and keep the browser window open
